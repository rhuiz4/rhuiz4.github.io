    <h1> Python Projects </h1>

    <h3> Machine Learning on NBA data set </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A project using machine learning techniques to classify NBA player positions using past <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv">NBA player stats</a> as data. More information can be found <a href="https://github.com/rhuiz4/NBAMachineLearning/blob/main/ML_Project_Writeup.pdf">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Sci-kit Learn</a> Library for machine learning functions and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> to organize and run code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Performed data preprocessing on the original data, then used different machine learning techniques to analyze data, including:
            <ul>

    <h3> Futoshiki Puzzle Solver</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A program that solves a 6x6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki">Futoshiki</a> puzzle. Given an initial board and both vertical and horizontal inequalities in an input file, the program will produce the answer to the puzzle in an output file.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rules:
            <ul>
                <li>The game board consists of 6 Ã— 6 cells. Some of the cells already have numbers (1 to 6)
                    assigned to them and there are inequality signs (< or >) placed horizontally or vertically
                    between some of the cells (See Figure 1.)</li>
                <li>The goal is to find assignments (1 to 6) for the empty cells such that the inequality
                    relationships between all pairs of adjacent cells with an inequality sign between them are
                    satisfied. In addition, a digit can only appear once in every row and column; that is, the
                    digits in every row and column must be different from each other</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses forward checking and backtracking algorithms with heuristic functions to determine the solution. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The source code and program instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/rhuiz4/Futoshiki_AI_Proj">here</a>.
